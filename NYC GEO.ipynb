    "## I. Introduction    \n",
    "Boston is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States, as well as the 21st most populous city in the United States. Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England. Today, Boston is a thriving port city. The Boston area's many colleges and universities make it an international center of higher education, including law, medicine, engineering, and business, and the city is considered to be a world leader in innovation and entrepreneurship, with nearly 2,000 startups.\n",
    "Along with its long history, food is a quintessential component of New York City. Cuisine in Boston is similar to the rest of New England cuisine, in that it has a large emphasis on seafood and dairy products. Its best-known dishes are New England clam chowder, fish and chips (usually with cod or scrod), baked beans, lobsters, steamed clams, and fried clams.      \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Union Oyster House** is the oldest operating restaurant in the United States. Their menu includes oysters on the half-shell served straight from an oyster bar, New England clam chowder, and other seafood dishes. Quincy Market, part of Faneuil Hall Marketplace, has a variety of restaurants and food shops. Nearby Cheers is a popular tourist dining spot.         \n",
    "\n",
    "Boston's **Chinatown** has a variety of Asian restaurants, bakeries, grocery stores, and medicinal herb and spice vendors. In addition to dim sum and other Chinese dining styles, there are Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean and Thai restaurants in the neighborhood.           \n",
    "\n",
    "The **North End** has a variety of Italian restaurants, pizzerias, and bakeries and is well known as Boston's \"Little Italy.\" A favorite spot bringing in tourists is Mike's Pastry, located on Hanover Street and is extremely popular for its cannolis. Newbury Street has many ethnic street cafes, while Copley Place houses a multitude of restaurants, also the home of Legal Sea Foods, a New England institution that offers gourmet seafood dishes.            \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to locate and recommend which neighborhood of Boston will be best choice to start a Chinese restaurant and explain the rationale of the recommendations."

In Chinatown, Chinese restaurant is the most common venue, which is pretty resonable, and in Dorchester, South Boston Waterfront, South Boston and Allston, Chinese restaurant is the third most common venue. Therefore, apart from Chinatown, which is an obvious option for opening a Chinese restaurant, neighborhoods like Dorchester, South Boston Waterfront, South Boston and Allston could also be reasonable options.**"
